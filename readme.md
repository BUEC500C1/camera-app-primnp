**Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment**

Please note:  If you have an iOS device, you need a Mac computer.  If you donâ€™t have a Mac, please build it as an Android on the emulator.
* I have a mac and have previously worked with react native both using expo CLI and react native CLI. For this project, I will use expo CLI. Note: I already have expo-cli installed on my laptop and also Expo Go application installed on my iPhone (iPhone 11 Pro Max).
* To set up work environment, run the following in terminal:
```
expo init [name]
```

<br>Note: in the image above, I did have to run <b>npm install -g expo-cli</b> again to get the latest version of expo-cli

**Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial**
1. Build Hello Applications (completed; App.js)
2. Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone. It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)
```
npm run ios or npm run android
```
