**Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment**

Please note:  If you have an iOS device, you need a Mac computer.  If you donâ€™t have a Mac, please build it as an Android on the emulator.
* I have a mac and have previously worked with react native both using expo CLI and react native CLI. For this project, I will use expo CLI. Note: I already have expo-cli installed on my laptop and also Expo Go application installed on my iPhone (iPhone 11 Pro Max).
* To set up work environment, run the following in terminal:
```
expo init [name]
```

<p align="center">
Figure 1. Set up expo CLI

<br>Note: in the image above, I did have to run <b>npm install -g expo-cli</b> again to get the latest version of expo-cli
</p>
<br />

**Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial**
1. Build Hello Applications (completed; App.js)
2. Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone. It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)
 * Set up android emulator on mac: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
```
npm run ios or npm run android
```

**Step 3:  Develop use case to display a map.  [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps)**

* Add google maps API key to the info plist so the mobile application can display google maps
* Create a pin and add picture for the location of 'Photonics building'
* View demonstratioin of this feature on 'Video 1' (refer below)

**Step 4:  Develop use case to take a picture  [react-native-camera](https://github.com/react-native-camera/react-native-camera)**

* Take a picture using react native camera and output the file location to console
* View demonstratioin of this feature on 'Video 1' (refer below)

## Due 03/30/2021 - DONE
**Step 5:  Setup your Firebase [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase).  Setup authentication, database, and storage**

* Set up authentication and database
* User can now log in to the application using existing username and password or create a new account
  * Users can not access any application features if they do not log in
* View demonstratioin of this feature on 'Video 1' (refer below)

**Step 6:  Store cloud data in the cloud and display as list on the phone**

* Develop a use case for user to add new data entry and automatically add that data entry to cloud firestore
* User can view list of data stored on cloud firestore with real time update
* View demonstratioin of this feature on 'Video 1' (refer below)

*Key takeaways*
* At this point, I realized that expo would not support barcode and face detection of react-native-camera. So I decided to switch to develop with bare react native project. Set up are as follow: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup (follow the steps for React Native CLI Quickstart).
* I decided to move forward with iOS development for react native as of now. Dependencies/library for android might be added later in the future.
* All files for iOS mobile appliciation are stored inside 'application' folder on this repo.

**Step 8: Scan barcodes and save the data per image**

* Use onBarCodeRead function to scan barcode
* User take a picture of barcode image then the text extracted from barcode and the image of the barcode are stored in firebase storage
* Display barcode image and extracted text as a list
* View demonstration of this feature on 'Video 2' (refer below) - barcode scanner features start at 1.36 minute mark

## Due 03/04/2021 - Partially done, only storing blurred face image left (depends on step 7)
**Step 9: Store images and barcode in Firebase**

* Store barcode image and extracted text in firebase
* If user take a picture of non-barcode image, text extracted field will be 'N/A' 
* View demonstration of this feature on 'Video 2' (refer above) - barcode scanner features and data storage start at 1.36 minute mark
